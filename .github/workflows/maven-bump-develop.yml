name: Bump Develop version after merge to Master

# Increment the Develop minor version after a Release branch is merged to Master
# Develop should be 0.1.0 (1 minor version) ahead of Master.
# Develop should always end with .0-SNAPSHOT as it's version number after this workflow is run.
# Note: This workflow will only run when a Pull Request from Release is CLOSED and MERGED to Master.
